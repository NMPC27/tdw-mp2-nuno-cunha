              <p>Hi, I{"'"}m Nuno Cunha! I{"'"}m a 5th year Informatics Engineering student at the University of Aveiro. I{"'"}m passionate about web development and internet of things. I{"'"}m also an avid soccer fan, and I{"'"}m always looking for ways to combine my interests. I hope you enjoy this project!</p>
              <p>Within the realm of my Technologies and Web Development course, I{"'"}m engrossed in an ambitious project. Fueled by React, this dynamic dashboard taps into external APIs, delivering real-time FIFA player data. Covering player essentials, detailed metrics, and affiliations with clubs, leagues, and nations, the platform promises a rich, immersive experience. The addition of a user-friendly search function enhances accessibility, catering to both casual users and dedicated FIFA enthusiasts. Join me on this journey as I delve into the intricacies of web development, API integration, and the fascinating world of player statistics!</p>
              <p>Crafting the FIFA Players Dashboard for my Technologies and Web Development course has been a condensed crash course in React, API integration, and continuous integration. This hands-on experience has sharpened my UI design skills, solidified my understanding of real-time data updates, and streamlined my development workflow.</p>
